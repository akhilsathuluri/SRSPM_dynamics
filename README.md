# SRSPM_dynamics
This repository contains Euler-Lagrangian dynamics models for simulating the semi-regular Stewart platform manipulator (SRSPM).
Apart from the classical task-space, configuration-space and the actuator-space dynamics models, this repository contains the extended-configuration-space modelling. 
This is a reduced order modelling compared to the modelling the complete 6n dimensional space and imposing constraints.
The extended-configuration-space is a balance between the sparsity of the model for computational efficiency and the accuracy of the solutions obtained and enables real-time simulation of the SRSPM.
